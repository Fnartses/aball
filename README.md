# aball
A Ball - Buttonless trackball for all
---
## A trackball with no buttons?
I like keyboards, and my workflow is defintely *keyboard first*.  Tiling window manager, VIM, bash... pretty 
much all the keyboard I can get.  Yet, however hard I try, there is always some need for a pointing device.  
So this is my stab at a trackball for keyboard first workflows.

Why not a mouse?  Well, space... trackballs take up less space.  Which got me thinking, what is the minimum 
footprint for a usable trackball?  I managed to get it down to 60x80mm... you could go even smaller, but I 
wanted some sort of case on it and this particular size sits nicely next to my daily driver, the [Kyria] (https://blog.splitkb.com/blog/introducing-the-kyria).

IMAGE HERE OF SETUP

In the quest to reduce size, I did away with any buttons.  I have plenty of buttons on my keyboard, and my 
left hand is capable of pressing them when I'm using the aball with my right hand.  Via a layer, I've 
mapped buttons on the home row to:
- F: Left Click
- D: Middle Click
- S: Right Click
- G: Scroll Up
- B: Scroll Down

Scroll up and down are not really needed, but they are pretty handy, even when not using the trackball.
